The OpenStreetMap Project

The OpenStreetMap project is an open source, collaborative endeavor to create free, user-generated maps of every part of the world. 
These maps are similar to the maps you might use in Google Maps or the Apple Maps app on your phone, but they are completely generated 
by individuals who volunteer to perform ground surveys of their local environment.

I write a code in C++ using real map data and A* search to find a path between two points, just as you might see in a desktop or mobile 
mapping application.

This project is based on udacity C++ nanodegree program.
